How do individuals arrive at decisions without consulting data? They rely on their past experiences and their comprehension of a given situation. Historically, this approach was necessary due to the difficulty in obtaining and comprehending data. However, the landscape of data accessibility has transformed significantly:

- We now have the capability to acquire data from every facet of our business.
- Data storage has become cost-effective, allowing us to amass substantial volumes of data.
- A plethora of tools exists to effortlessly extract, transform, and visualize data.

While dashboards cannot alter an individual's past experiences, they can serve as a means to surface data, enhancing one's understanding of a situation and aiding in better decision-making. Dashboards function as a bridge connecting data-oriented individuals (such as yourself) with business professionals (David, 2023).

## Introduction to Data Dashboarding

Data analysis software can process vast volumes of data at impressive speeds, but there is a challenge when it comes to explaining the outcomes of this analysis. Currently, the primary method for accomplishing this is through visual representations. However, there is still room for interpretation in data visualization. Fortunately, technology is advancing in this regard. Narrative generation software can be integrated as a plugin into dashboards (Manning 2016).Top of Form

Whenever there's a need to present information for the purpose of enhancing decision-making, the concept of designing a dashboard should be considered. A well-crafted dashboard serves as a platform to arrange multiple data visualizations, ensuring the provision of sufficient context for making well-informed decisions.

<br>
For instance, take a look at this user data dashboard, designed as an illustrative example. This dashboard is designed to monitor key metrics for a SaaS (Software as a Service) company. It offers an immediate overview of essential data, including revenue, operational expenses, total user counts, and other pertinent information that can be assessed.

<br>
Such a dashboard can be invaluable to the CEO or anyone within the organization, offering a high-level snapshot of the current situation and assisting in determining where to focus their attention. "_For instance, my operational expenses surpass my revenue; I should reach out to my COO to gain insights into our excessive spending_."

<br>
This dashboard comprises various data visualizations, presenting viewers with the necessary context to glean insights and make informed decisions. An effective dashboard is also dynamic, adapting to changes in the underlying data automatically. This ensures that time-sensitive insights and decisions can be promptly addressed.

## Data Dashboards vs Data Visualizations

Two common terms when it comes to analytics and reporting are “data dashboard” and “data visualization.” What’s the difference?

<br>

- **Data visualization** involves the presentation of data in a visual format, aiming to enhance its comprehensibility and analysability.
- **Data dashboards** serve as consolidated summaries of distinct yet interrelated data sets, presented in a manner that simplifies the comprehension of their interconnected information. Dashboards essentially fall under the category of data visualizations and commonly employ familiar visualization tools like graphs, charts, and tables.

## 3 Basic Types of Data Dashboard

Data dashboards can have diverse functions and cater to various objectives. While they are typically associated with business intelligence, their specific purposes can vary depending on the service or team they cater to. Consequently, we can categorize BI dashboards into three fundamental types:

- Operational Dashboards
- Analytical Dashboards
- Strategic Dashboards

Each of these types is designed in alignment with its primary tasks. When selecting the type of dashboard, it's crucial to consider the distinctions that impact both their functionalities and their design (_Ratibor Sekirov, 2021_).

## 8 Benefits of Data Dashboard

## Designing Effective Data Dashboards

The application of design thinking to dashboards can pose challenges. Business Intelligence tools have made it incredibly convenient to generate visualizations and dashboards. The temptation to promptly construct multiple dashboards to assist people is strong. Nevertheless, without dedicating ample time to defining the issues, identifying stakeholders, specifying metrics, or prototyping ideal designs, these dashboards are likely to be ineffective. Embracing the Define and Prototyping stages is crucial for dashboard designers, as it results in dashboards that resonate with their audience and are better aligned with the decisions that audience needs to make (David, 2023).

The design thinking process to dashboards:

**Define ---> Prototype ---> Build ---> Deploy**

## Best Practices for Data Dashboard

The guidelines for constructing and utilizing dashboards can differ between organizations and individuals. It's crucial to keep your overarching objective for the dashboard and its intended audience in mind, while also considering these essential aspects for crafting an effective dashboard (_What Is a Dashboard? A Complete Overview_, 2023).

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Avoid inundating your audience with excessive data. Select only the most pertinent information and present it in a comprehensible manner.
- **Elements:** Ensure the appropriate choice of charts, graphs, and tables for each dataset. The optimal visual representation enhances comprehension.
- **Design:** Prioritize the clarity of your dashboard at first glance by structuring the data logically and maintaining a consistent colour scheme.
- **Labels:** Exercise brevity and ensure clear labelling for all data elements.
- **Interactivity:** Employ interactive elements when necessary. These features facilitate deeper data exploration or highlight variations within the data

## Dashboard Design Pattern

There exist several overarching principles for creating dashboards, encompassing recommendations regarding visual perception, information simplification, the incorporation of interactive elements, and promoting visualization comprehension. However, our knowledge of truly effective and practical dashboard design, as well as how to facilitate swift dashboard creation, remains somewhat limited.

<br>
It's worth acknowledging that designing dashboards is not a straightforward task. Designers are presented with a multitude of data sources that they can process, condense, or simplify according to their judgment. They also have access to a wide array of visual representations and the flexibility to structure and present these visualizations in various formats, taking advantage of the ample screen space available for viewing (as opposed to individual plots that prioritize space efficiency).

<br>
The abundance of choices can be overwhelming, underscoring the pressing need for guidance on achieving effective dashboard design. This is particularly relevant as dashboards are increasingly created for a broader audience that may lack expertise in visualization or interface design, and by designers who may not have a background in these fields (_Dashboarddesignpatterns.github.io_, 2022).
